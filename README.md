This repo contains corrections to transcripts / dictionaries in datasets that I've edited as part of my work.

CSS10 Spanish - cleaned invalid characters like `bÅ“uf` to `bœuf`. `Vds.` should be normalized to `Ustedes`. `Yquién` to `Y quién`. `Schöenbrunn` to `Schönbrunn`. Split joined words like `unaJunta`. 
AISHELL-3 test set - edited instances of 地 where it should be di4. 东莞 should be guan3 not wan3. 什么 should be shen3 me5, not shen2 me5 (also edited all impacted sandhi like 有 you3 > you2 什 shen3 么 and previous tones 菜谱 pu2 > pu3 有 you2 什 shen3 么).
CMU Dictionary - corrected invalid pronunciations
